This repository contains [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) implementations of models from various papers. My plan is to first focus on generative image models.

Currently, I have
- [Variational autoencoder](vae/) from [1] (Completed)
- [DRAW](draw/) from [2] (Completed)

See the README file under its folder for instructions on running a model.

The code in this repository was tested under Python 3.5.2. You can find all the required python packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

Please open up an issue if there is a particular model you'd like me to implement.
